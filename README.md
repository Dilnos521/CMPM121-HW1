This scene is a scene of a canine traveler resting at a rather strange resting stop. I included a few things that make the spot a bit odd while having some things the trvler might have had with him. One inspiration I had was the image of a traveler resting by a campfire, though in this case it's more like resting by a barrel, as well as a scene from the start of Half-Life 2's Ravenholm, at least for the sort of bleakness. The main character of this scene is the canine traveler.
